/**
* 	Core class of the Picture2ASCII software. Picture2ASCII is a simple and academical purpose oriented library to convert pictures to ASCII. It handles
* 	10 levels of resolution with and without sub-sampling (what leads to "result compression"). The conversion procedure is threaded in both cases to fully
* 	benefit from multi-core modern computers. The input images are expected to be in RGB with 24 bits of color depth. The library will perform a previous 
* 	internal conversion in any other case to fulfill this requirement.
*	This tool has been developed with academical purpose for "Sistemas Multimedia", a subject of the Computing Engineering Master at the University of Almeria.
*	The software is distributed to anyone interested at it without any kind of warranty. It can be used and modified by everybody with the only requirement of referring the original author. 
*	@author  NicolÃ¡s C., University of Almeria
*	@version 1.0
